It all depends
It could be worse
It cuts both ways
It does my head in
It drives you mad
It just so happens
It looks like rain
It makes no odds
It serves you right
It takes one to know one
It will all end in tears
It would be a brave man

Its a hard life
Its a mugs game
Its a small world
Its a toss up
Its all Greek to me
Its all a matter of taste
Its all go
Its another world
Its anybodys guess
Its anyones guess
Its as broad as its long
Its just a matter of time
Its never too late
Its that man again
Its tough at the top
Its your funeral

it
it all adds up
it beggars belief
it bores me to tears
it comes to the same thing
it could be better
it cuts no ice
it does no harm
it does not add up
it does the trick
it gets on my wick
it girl
it gladdens the heart
it goes without saying
it just doesnt add up
it just goes to show
it keeps cropping up
it makes a change
it makes my blood boil
it makes no sense
it makes you want to weep
it makes you weep
it might never happen
it must be catching
it never rains but it pours
it remains to be seen
it rings a bell
it runs in the family
it speaks to the heart
it stands to reason
it sticks out a mile
it suits me
it takes all sorts
it takes time
it takes two to tango
it was all go
it was fun while it lasted
it was not to be
it wont go unnoticed 
it wont wash
it works a treat
it works both ways
it'll
it's a fair cop
it's a free country
